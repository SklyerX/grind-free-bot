                <p>The reason we use discord tokens in order to send messages is because we have auto-replying features in our services which you can enable! We also use discord tokens to change your nickname in the target server so the mods get confused if you have a common profile. <span style={{ "color": "#f00"}}>If you want to use this app we recommend using a new discord account NOT YOUR MAIN</span></p>
